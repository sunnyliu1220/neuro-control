# neuro-control
This project aims to apply control theory to perturbation experiments in neuroscience. Here is a rough roadmap:

- First, start with simple dynamical systems (e.g. linear) and explore the effects of partial observation, observation time, network size, etc. on the system identification performance. We try to reproduce some of the results in this paper: `[Link Text](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.24.595741)`. T
